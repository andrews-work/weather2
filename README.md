## JavaScript Expertise

I've demonstrated my JavaScript skills in creating this advanced weather app:

1. **API Integration:** I've effectively integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the specified location.

2. **Asynchronous Operations:** Asynchronous operations are managed smoothly using `fetch` to retrieve data from the API.

3. **State Management:** The application employs state management through React's `useState` hook to update weather data and toggle visibility of different forecast sections.

4. **Date and Time Manipulation:** I've utilized the `moment-timezone` library to handle date and time conversion based on user and location timezones.

5. **Conditional Rendering:** I've used conditional rendering to display different forecast sections and toggle their visibility.

6. **Function Composition:** I've composed functions for temperature and wind speed conversion to enhance code readability and maintainability.

7. **Responsive UI:** The app is designed with a responsive user interface for seamless use on different devices.
